/** Author: Andrew Lam
 *  Course: CS 2450
 *  Assignment: Assignment 1
 *  Due Date: 02.27.2023
 *  Objective:  Dice Simulator - Create a JavaFX application that simulates rolling a pair of dice. When the user clicks
 *              a button, the application should generate two random numbers, each in the range of 1 through 6, to
 *              represent the value of the dice. Use ImageView controls to display the dice. (In the Dice.zip file
 *              on canvas, you will find six images named Die1.png, Die2.png, Die3.png, Die4.png, Die5.png,
 *              and Die6.png that you can use in the ImageView controls.)
